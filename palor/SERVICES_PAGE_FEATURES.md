## How It Works

### Admin Creates Service
1. Admin goes to `/admin/services`
2. Clicks "Add New Service"
3. Fills form with service details and uploads image
4. Submits form → Service created in database

### Public Page Updates
1. Services page fetches from same API endpoint (`/api/v1/services`)
2. Only shows **active** services to public users
3. Auto-refreshes every 30 seconds
4. Users can manually refresh anytime

### API Integration
```javascript
// Endpoint used by both admin and public pages
GET /api/v1/services

// Response structure
{
  "statusCode": 200,
  "message": {
    "services": [...],
    "pagination": {...}
  },
  "data": "Services retrieved successfully",
  "success": true
}
```

## Navigation Integration

### Home Page Links
- **Carousel**: "Our Services" button → `/services`
- **Services Preview**: "View All Services" button → `/services`
- **Call to Action**: "Browse Services" button → `/services`

### Navbar
- **Services**: Direct link in main navigation
